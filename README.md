## Disclaimer to GitHub Staff and Other Employees

**Telehack.com** is an online game that simulates hacking, accessible via SSH, Telnet, or a web browser. It provides an immersive experience by recreating ARPANET, USENET, and other systems from the 20th century.

## Overview

This script, **clean-the-output-from-milnet**, does **not** provide the offset directly; it simply cleans the output from the Milnet exploit on Telehack.

## Detailed Explanation

This script doesn't calculate the offset for you but instead removes the top and sidebar sections containing numeric and alphabetical markers. You can use this to clean up unnecessary line markers that indicate offsets, allowing you to paste a cleaner version into a hex editor or similar tool. 

I created it because it helps me efficiently find the correct offset on a Milnet host.

## Usage

- Run the script on the output from the Milnet exploit to remove unnecessary markers.
- The cleaned output can then be used for further analysis or editing in a hex editor.
